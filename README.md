## Client Side Documentation Generator

Allows for quick generation of Client Side Tags

 * Generates a JSON definition of the documentation.
 * Downloads a Markdown file ready to be converted into Lithium Styled HTML.



### Instructions
Since it is just an HTML page with jQuery on it, to use:

 * Clone or download the repo.
 * Navigate to the folder and open ```docgen.html```.
 * Fill out the form and click Generate.

#### Notes:

* The title field will be used to fill in the name of the integration within the documentation, so capitalization and spacing does matter.  It will be normalized before it is used for the file name.
* For ```Data Categories```, the keywords ```E-Commerce``` and ```Events``` will automatically include an introduction to these mapping tabs. Because of this, it is reccommended that these two (if needed) be added only after the ```Standard``` and ```Custom``` tabs.
* This is meant to serve as a jumpstart to the documentation process, not a one stop shop.  Please convert the MD file and verify/make changes as necessary.
